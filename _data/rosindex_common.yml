# rosdep / xylem platforms
#
# This is a list of platforms and versions found in the rosdep database if a
# platform / version key isn't found here, then it will throw and error and
# should either be added or fixed if it was erroneous.
#
# Each key under 'versions' is a map from version identifier to version
# display name. If the display name is empty, then the capitalized version of
# the identifier will be used.
